# learn-analog-clock
An interactive, educational web application built to help children and young adults understand how analog clocks work. By dragging the individual hands for seconds, minutes, and hours, users can see in real-time how the units of time relate to one another.

## 💡 Background & Motivation

With the rapid shift to smartphones and digital devices, reading an analog clock has quickly become a fading skill. Recent viral discussions and informal surveys have highlighted a startling trend: **it is estimated that up to 70% of Gen-Z in Indonesia struggle to read a traditional analog clock.** Because they grew up in an era where time is exclusively presented in digital formats (e.g., `14:30`), the spatial reasoning and base-60 math required to read an analog clock face are no longer acquired naturally. Traditional teaching methods often rely on static worksheets that fail to explain the mechanical relationship between the hands. 

**This project exists to fix that.** By splitting the clock into three separate, interactive dials (Hours, Minutes, Seconds) and mathematically binding them together, users can physically *feel* how time works. When they drag the minute hand a full 360 degrees, they instantly see the hour hand advance proportionally, creating an intuitive "aha!" moment that bridges the gap between digital habits and analog skills.
